              <p>The coronavirus has penetrated nearly every aspect of our lives and the world of trademarks is not immune.</p>

              <p>You can read the entirety of the USPTO’s message here: https://www.uspto.gov/coronavirus</p>

              <p>Practically speaking, the pandemic shouldn’t affect the average trademark application filer. While all of the USPTO offices are closed to the public, employees are still going to work. “Unless otherwise notified, USPTO operations will continue without interruption. Patent and trademark application deadlines and other deadlines are not extended.”</p>

              <p>Now when it comes to fees, the only fees being waived, as of now, relate to the petitions.</p>

              <p>So, if you have an ABANDONED application OR a CANCELLED/EXPIRED registration and the failure to respond was related to the COVID-19 outbreak, “the USPTO will waive the petition fee.”</p>

              <p>“If the applicant or registrant did not receive a notice of abandonment or cancellation, the petition must be filed not later than six months after the date the trademark electronic records system indicates that the application is abandoned or the registration is canceled/expired.”</p>

              <p>“In all cases, the petition must include a statement explaining how the failure to respond to the Office communication was due to the effects of the Coronavirus outbreak.”</p>

              <p>You can read the entire notice here: https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/coronavirus_relief_ognotice_03162020.pdf</p>

              <p>Now, there are NO waiver or extensions of dates or requirements for the following:</p>

              <p>“(1) the 36-month period set forth in 15 U.S.C. § 105l(d) within which a statement of use must be filed and the associated fee(s);” aka EXTENSIONS & the STATEMENT OF USE</p>

              <p>“(2) the periods set forth in 15 U.S.C. §§ 1058, 114 l(k) for filing affidavits of continued use or excusable nonuse and the associated fee(s);” aka the Section 8
              </p>
              <p>“(3) the period set forth in 15 U.S.C. § 1059 for filing a renewal and the associated fee(s);” aka the Section 9</p>

              <p>“(4) the periods set forth in 15 U.S.C. §§ 1063 and 1064 for filing an opposition or cancellation proceeding at the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board” aka if this applies to you, an attorney is helping you</p>

              <p>It may not be the best of times ahead for LeBron James’ recent trademark filing for Taco Tuesday.</p>

              <p>On August 15, King James’ company LBJ Trademarks, LLC has filed for a Federal trademark for “Taco Tuesday” within four different classifications of goods and services. Looks like there’s a plan in the works for a podcast, “downloadable audio/visual works” as well as “a website featuring non-downloadable videos, and social media posts in the field of sports, entertainment, current events and popular culture.”</p>

              <p>There’s been some public debate about whether or not a trademark is even possible for that phrase. But that’s already been decided and the answer was, yes. Taco John’s filed for Taco Tuesday for restaurant services in 1989 and has maintained the registration since then. They’ve even made some waves sending out cease and desist letters “for over two decades.”</p>

              <p>But that’s not the potential hiccup for James’ new filing. Research of the USPTO Trademark database shows that there’s a registered mark out there that could prove to be problematic.</p>

              <p>There are some services listed that could conflict with an already registered trademark, Techno Taco Tuesday. LeBron James’ trademark also filed for “advertising and marketing services…;” however, MNTRA Entertainment LLC of Las Vegas has had Techno Taco Tuesday trademarked since June 26, 2018 for “advertising, marketing and promotion services” among other related services. Their first use date for these services is May 20, 2014.</p>

              <p>All of this could prove to be an issue for the basketball player’s filing in that (1) the marks are similar in Sound & Appearance, (2) the International Classification is the same, 35, (3) the Services are related, and (4) MNTRA’s usage has been in use for 5+ years whereas James’ filing was an Intent to Use, meaning use is not yet being claimed.</p>

              <p>In fact, the USPTO has already refused two other Taco Tuesday marks (same owner) because of Techno Taco Tuesday’s registration. Here’s what they had to say:</p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>“In this case, applicant’s mark TACO TUESDAY is confusingly similar to the mark TECHNO TACO TUESDAY in Registration No. 5505122. Specifically, TACO TUESDAY in applicant’s mark is highly similar in sound and appearance to the TACO TUESDAY in registrant’s mark in Registration No. 5505122…</p>

                <p>Moreover, the applicant’s mark TACO TUESDAY is wholly encompassed within the registrant’s mark TECHNO TACO TUESDAY in Registration No. 5505122, thus, purchasers are likely to believe that registrant’s mark merely identifies an additional line of advertising, marketing and promotional services. Specifically, purchasers are likely to believe that the mark TECHNO TACO TUESDAY in Registration No. 5505122 identifies a new line of advertising, marketing and promotional services offered under the TACO TUESDAY line of advertising and promotional services. Incorporating the entirety of one mark within another does not obviate the similarity between the compared marks, as in the present case, nor does it overcome a likelihood of confusion under Section 2(d)…</p>

                <p>In summary, because of the contemporaneous use of the distinctive phrase TACO TUESDAY, it follows that purchasers are likely to believe that the marks identify the same source for advertising and promotional services and advertising, marketing and promotional services. Thus, the marks are confusingly similar.”</p>
              </blockquote>

              <p>The applicant for Taco Tuesday didn’t reply to the refusals in a timely manner so it remains to be seen if there’s a persuasive enough argument out there for the USPTO. And given this precedence, it seems fairly likely that James’ filing should receive a similar refusal for the advertising related services.</p>

              <p>  Now that you know what a trademark is, what a trademark isn’t, and that you should get a trademark, let’s explore if a State trademark or Federal trademark is most appropriate for your needs.</p>

              <p>For the USA, trademarks can be obtained either at the State level or the Federal level. So, which do you need? I’ll explain both and that’ll give you a clearer picture as where to go from here.</p>

              <p>First and foremost, a State trademark gives you trademark protection for that specific state whereas a Federal trademark gives you trademark protection nationwide. Simple enough, yes? But, which is the right trademark for your needs?</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Are you actively in business?</li>
                <li>Are you only doing business in one city or county or just statewide?</li>
              </ol>
              <p>If you answered yes to both, then exploring a State trademark is your next step. Here are some advantages to a State trademark:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>The right to expand statewide. The name will be waiting for you in other metros.</li>
                <li>If another mark is infringing upon yours within the state, you’ll have access to State courts.</li>
                <li>Other entities will much more readily accept your trademark and first use common law rights when you have a registered State trademark.</li>
                <li>Future Federal trademarks will not be able to be used commercially anywhere in your State, thus giving you a strategic advantage against larger competitors.</li>
              </ul>


              <p>While a State trademark certainly has its advantages, the increase in Federal filings over the years shows the influence of the internet and the wide reach possible for even the smallest of businesses. So, first, let’s make sure you can even qualify for a Federal trademark.</p>

              <ol>
                <li>Are you currently in business in at least 2 states and/or between the USA & any other country?</li>
                <li>If you’re not yet in business or in business in only one state, do you have plans to expand to another state or states or other countries?</li>
              </ol>

              <p>Before you answer yes or no, it’s important to define what being “in business” actually means in respect to the trademark world. To qualify for a Federal trademark, the mark must be in use in interstate commerce. “For goods (i.e. products), "Interstate commerce" involves sending the goods across state lines with the mark displayed on the goods or the packaging for the goods. With services, "Interstate commerce" involves offering a service to those in another state or rendering a service that affects interstate commerce (e.g. restaurants, gas stations, hotels, etc.).”</p>

              <p>So, if you answered yes to either of those questions and your business is truly involved in either interstate, “territorial (between the United States and a territory of the United States), (or) foreign commerce (between the United States and a foreign country),” then exploring a Federal trademark is the way to go.</p>
